# Challenge Card Ideas

This document tracks challenge card concepts and status as we work through them.

## Implemented
- Double Down: Double all reps this round.
- Iron Boost: Add 5 reps to every active exercise.
- Sprint Surge: Add one extra 50 yard sprint.

## Proposed
- Half Time: Cut all reps in half this round.
- Iron Grip: Add +10 reps to squats only.
- Cardio Spike: Add two extra sprints this round.
- Slow Burn: Add +3 reps to every exercise for the next 2 rounds.
- Face Card Fever: Treat all face cards as 12 reps this round.
- Lucky Ace: Aces count as 1 rep this round.
- Suit Swap: Hearts and diamonds swap exercises this round.
- Joker's Choice: Pick one exercise and double it; others stay normal.

## Notes
- Challenge cards should behave like physical inserts in the deck.
- Multiple challenges in the same draw should stack for that round.
