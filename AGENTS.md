# Repository Guidelines

## Theming
- Any new UI elements or components must explicitly support both the **standard** and **rugged** themes. Ensure styles, classes, and assets are compatible with each theme.

## Development Workflow
- Follow a **test-driven development** (TDD) approach. Write or update failing tests before implementing fixes or features, then ensure the tests pass.
- Keep tests up to date with behavior changes and ensure they cover the new functionality.
- Running tests is not required for updating things that don't need to be tested: e.g. README updates, GitHub Actions updates, etc.

## Additional Practices
- Maintain clear and concise documentation or comments when behavior might not be obvious.
- Prefer small, focused commits with descriptive messages.
