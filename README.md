# Deck of Gains 💪📈

Welcome to **Deck of Gains**, the app that turns a deck of cards into your personal trainer. Forget spreadsheets and boring routines—this is where fitness meets chaos and card tables. Whether you’re here to spice up your workouts, dominate your fitness tribe, or just prove how rugged you are, **Deck of Gains** has you covered.

**NOTE:** Almost everything you see here is AI-generated. I make no guarantees of code quality or correctness!

## What It Does 🎲
1. Draw cards from a virtual deck.
2. Each card assigns an exercise and reps based on its suit and value:
   - **♥️ Hearts**: Jumping Jacks
   - **♠️ Spades**: Squats
   - **♦️ Diamonds**: Pushups
   - **♣️ Abs**: Abs (and yes, the reps are doubled because we’re savage like that).
3. Complete all the exercises and finish the round with a 50-yard sprint.
4. **Last round?** Draw 8 cards and do TWO sprints, because why not?
5. When the deck is done, it’s BURPEE TIME. Keep going until your soul leaves your body (or the clock says 30 minutes, whichever comes first).

## The Rugged Theme 🪓🔥
You think you’re hardcore? You’re not rugged enough until you hit **Deck of Gains** with the `?theme=rugged` query param (the classic `?rugged=true` link still works for your old bookmarks). This mode transforms the app into something that looks like it crawled out of a Viking gym.

Here’s what the **Rugged Theme** brings:
- A dark, smoky background to remind you of the battlefield of gains.
- Fiery orange and gold highlights that scream, "I EAT BURPEES FOR BREAKFAST."
- Hover effects on cards so epic they might just make you flex involuntarily.
- Fonts so bold you’ll think they’ve been benching their whole life.

Activate the **Rugged Theme** and prove you’re ready to enter the tribe of legends.

## How to Use 🛠️
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. **Add to Home Screen** for a full-screen experience (especially on iOS).
3. Hit "Draw Cards" and let the pain begin.
4. Once the deck is done, hit "New Set" to start over—or collapse in glory.
5. Want to go **RUGGED**? Add `?theme=rugged` to the URL (or the legacy `?rugged=true`) and watch the screen turn into a warrior’s playground.
6. Your configuration *and* active workout are mirrored in the URL, so refreshing the page or sharing the link drops you—and your unsuspecting friends—right back into the current round. Suits are shortened to `h/s/d/c` codes to keep those links lean.

## Auto-Draw & Sound FX 🎧
- Toggle **Auto-Draw** from the configuration screen to automatically draw the next hand for you. It defaults to 2.5 minutes between draws, but you can dial the interval up or down to fit your rest window.
- Each draw fires off a quick audio cue so you never miss the next hand. The classic casino theme delivers a slick "whoosh" while Rugged mode punches in with a heavy hit.

## Why This Exists 🤔
Because working out should be fun. Or at least unpredictable. Or, at the very least, rugged.

Fitness doesn’t have to mean monotonous reps and boring routines. It should feel like a fight scene from a medieval epic. Or a high-stakes poker game where the stakes are your quads. Whatever you envision, **Deck of Gains** is here to spice up your sweat sessions.

## Pro Tips 🧠
- **Short on time?** Sprint harder.
- **Don’t skip abs.** You’ll regret it later.
- **Feeling heroic?** Rugged Theme is your calling.
- **Invite friends.** Nothing says "bonding" like screaming through burpees together.
